//! A task queue where the processing of tasks can generate additional subtasks.
//!
//! This module implements a stream where the consumer of the stream can request
//! additional items to be added to the stream. An example where this is useful
//! is fetching a package including all the transitive dependencies: we start
//! with a stream that just yields the package we want to fetch. The consumer can
//! then fetch a package and add all dependencies of that package to the stream,
//! adding them to the set of packages that need to be fetched.
//!
//! The data structure is called a work set because it allows assigning a key to
//! each item to avoid duplicates. A new item will only be added if no prior item
//! had the same key.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate futures;
//! extern crate nix_index;
//!
//! use futures::{Stream};
//! use nix_index::workset::{WorkSet};
//! use std::iter::{self, FromIterator};
//!
//! #[derive(Clone)]
//! struct Package {
//!     name: String,
//!     dependencies: Vec<Package>,
//! }
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     // set up some data
//!     let pkgA = Package { name: "a".to_string(), dependencies: vec![] };
//!     let pkgB = Package { name: "b".to_string(), dependencies: vec![] };
//!     let pkgC = Package { name: "c".to_string(), dependencies: vec![pkgA.clone(), pkgB] };
//!     let pkgD = Package { name: "d".to_string(), dependencies: vec![pkgA, pkgC] };
//!
//!     // construct a workset that has `pkgD` as initial item.
//!     let workset = WorkSet::from_iter(iter::once((pkgD.name.clone(), pkgD)));
//!
//!     // fetch the names of all transitive dependencies of `pkgD`. In real cases,
//!     // this would probably perform some network requests or other IO with futures.
//!     let all_packages = workset.map(|(mut handle, pkg)| {
//!         let Package { name, dependencies } = pkg;
//!         // add all dependencies to the workset
//!         for pkg in dependencies {
//!             handle.add_work(pkg.name.clone(), pkg);
//!         }
//!         name
//!     });
//!
//!    // all_packages is now a stream of all the names of the transitive dependencies of pkgD
//!    // and pkgD itself
//! }
//! ```
